# 'GithubUserInfo' Elm Example Application 

This application is built using [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) and uses the [elm-webpack-4-starter](https://github.com/romariolopezc/elm-webpack-4-starter/) as build template to quickly incorporate styling and static elements into the app as well.

This example application allows someone to search for a username on GitHub, and will then display part of their public user information in the interface.

This example application is used for the presentation that can be found in this repository as well, as well as online at https://slides.com/qqwy/elm-and-sass/.
